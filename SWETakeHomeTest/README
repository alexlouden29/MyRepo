I designed this with the idea in mind that I work for a software company, not the school itself.
Therefore, I reasoned other schools might come to us wanting the same technology, and made it easy to
add both schools and criteria, and share criteria logic across schools if desired.  To do this I followed
the filter (criteria) design pattern.

Assumptions:
For the GPA instant Reject, the prompt states that GPA's BELOW 70% should be rejected, but the example given
is EXACTLY 70%.  I opted to follow the wording, so the example would actually not be rejected

My school is named California University College, or CAUC.

Other colleges could potentially want to be added, and may want some of the same, and some different criteria.

I made some logical assumptions about required fields for an applicant, and some basic validation.

This source brought the filter pattern to my attention, and I followed it's technique with lists and lambdas.
After learning about lambdas in my java course, I couldn't pass up a good opportunity to actually apply them.

I used this channel to learn about several design patterns, singleton and Factory are most relevant here.
