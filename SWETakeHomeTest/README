I designed this with the idea in mind that I work for a software company, not the school itself.
Therefore, I reasoned other schools might come to us wanting the same technology, and made it easy to
add both schools and criteria, and share criteria logic across schools if desired.  To do this I followed
the filter design pattern.

Assumptions:
My school is named California University College, or CACU.
Other colleges could potentially want to be added, and may want some of the same, and some different criteria.
